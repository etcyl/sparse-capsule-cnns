# sparse-capsule-cnns
WARNING: Probably the wrong way to describe this. 

Attempting a capsule model inlcuding YOLO-like models but with sparse connections, single dedicated outputs, and parallel computing ability across a multicore system using Keras and OpenCV in Python. How does running multiple sparse CNN models in parallel and limiting each unique output of the CNN models affect accuracy of the overall "capsule" and the performance of the host computer?
